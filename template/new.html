        <h1>WHAT IS A BLOCKCHAIN? </h1>
          <br/>

          A distributed ledger is a consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data geographically spread across multiple sites, countries, and/or institutions. Users of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) significantly benefit from the efficiencies by creating a more robust environment for real-time and secure data sharing. A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded timestamped data in packages called blocks. These digitally recorded “blocks” of dataare stored in a linear “chain”. Each block in the chain contains data, is cryptographically hashed. The blocks of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which came before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall “blockchain” has not been tampered with and remains unchanged. While blockchain technology has come to be thought of primarily as the foundation forbitcoin, it hasevolved far beyondsupport for virtual currency.There is no single machine that governs the business logic or the data on which a blockchain operates. Instead, the data on a blockchain is determinedbyconsensus, which is a well-defined convention for how to execute and administer the business logic (e.g., to update the stock of a certain good). The blockchain and its surrounding incentive structure allowsusers tounambiguouslydiscover the state of the system (e.g., the current level of stock or the origin of a particular certificate), not from a single particular authority but rather by independently applying common rules and publishing data openly.With the blockchain, it does not matter who or where the user is, because all information provided to the blockchain is accepted only if it isauthenticated. This authentication is provided in the form of an unforgeable digital signature: a cryptographic mechanism thatallows someone to prove their identity without enabling someone else to impersonate them. It does not matter what your job is or what your access capabilities happen to be, as you simply cannot interact with the blockchain unless you provide the digital “key” required for the interaction that you own (e.g., unless you cryptographically prove the ownership of your account, there is no way for anybody else to change it). This means that elevated privilege levels are removed entirely, and the security risk of the weakest link — in the form of operators and IT administrators — is drastically reduced.In a blockchainsystem, it is possible to strictly verify and audit the actions within the system as being correct; the inputs and outputs of the system serve as a record of the various interactions (e.g., receipt of the harvested olives at the point of pressing to oil) that have led the system into its present state. To perform this audit in practice comes with one constraint:allinformation concerningallinputs must be provided. In traditional systems, this is expensive, impractical, or impossible. The inputs to a business system typically include heterogeneousdata types coming from a wide variety of sources. The auditing, which would require “replaying”the sequence ofsuch inputs. Thisistechnically very challenging. Auditing may also require strong knowledge and assurance of operator identity, which can often be compromised or flawed in a system with many Actors. Combined with the absolute guarantees of authenticity for every interaction, strong and agile data systems can be facilitated that are at their core resilient to coercion and human factors.

CONSENSUS MECHANISMS
At the heart of the blockchain is a consensus among the participants. Consensus is key, because without a central authority, the participants have to agree on the rules and how to apply them. Using these rules, the nodes need to agree to accept and record a proposed transaction, which is to become a block on the Blockchain. There is no need for a middleman between parties in a transaction. There is also no need for trust from one peer to the next, since the consensus algorithms, running on the Blockchain participants’ nodes provides all of the necessary confidence. If a Blockchain is well-implemented, the resulting advantages include speed, privacy, reliability, and much lower cost.The mechanism is as follows. A transaction, after being created and posted to the network, is signed with the signature of the transaction’s initiator, which indicates the intention to spend money, create a contract, or pass data parameters of the transaction (such as measurement data, etc.) If the transaction is signed, it contains all of the data necessary for execution. A transaction is broadcast to the nodes in the system, discarding invalid transactions along the way (invalid signatures, etc.). The network of computer nodes verifies and validates by running an algorithm that continuously replicates the ledger. This network verifies, validates and approves. A confirmation is broadcast to the other nodes in the system. Consensus (an agreed mathematical mechanism) is recorded and provides the basis for the trust mechanism. A transaction, once verified will be included in a block. The block will be distributed to the network. Once the network reaches a consensus on the block, it is added to the end of the blockchain (hence, “chain”).There are many different ways to reach consensus. “Proof of work” systems maintain Blockchains with a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptographic protocol. They don’t have any centralized authority, but they do assume that ‘honest’ nodes control at least a majority of the systems nodes. These nodes are public permissionless systems and they do not need to know who the other nodes are. Proof of work systems verify and add transactions to the Blockchain and as a ‘reward’ for such mining activities earn currency (e.g. Bitcoins).There are other “Proof of x” consensus mechanisms, which have strong security properties but which require significantly less computer power and can be completed much more quickly.The Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)consensus algorithmimpartially determines who will commit a transaction to state using a lottery function that elects a leader from many different distributed nodes.Hyperledger Sawtooth’s PoET algorithm differs from the Proof of Work algorithm implemented by the Bitcoin blockchain in that Proof of Work relies on vast amounts of power, while Proof of Elapsed Time is able to ensure trust and randomness in electing a leader without the high power consumption. PoET allows for increased scalability and participation, as every node in the network has an equal opportunity to createthe next block on the chain.

To start, each validator within the networkrequests a wait time from an enclave, or a trusted function. This is where the "Elapsed Time" comes into play. The validator with the shortest wait time for a specific block is appointed the leader, andcreates the block to be committed to the ledger. As a result, a truly random leader is elected, and the amount of power or type of hardware you have will not give you an advantage. Using simple functions, the network can verify that the winning validator did indeed "win", by proving thatit had the shortest time to wait before assuming the leadership position

IMPORTANT PROPERTIES OF THE BLOCKCHAIN
It is decentralized
The data is cryptographically stored inside each entry on the blockchain
The blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with the data that is inside the blockchain
The blockchain is transparent so one can track the data if they want to
Each operation and interaction with the blockchain is perfectly auditable
SMART CONTRACTS
Smart contracts are computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract. They are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. The code and the agreements contained in them exist across a distributed, decentralized blockchain network. Smart contracts permit trusted transactions and agreements to be carried out among disparate, anonymous parties without the need for a central authority, legal system, or external enforcement mechanism. They render transactions traceable, transparent, and irreversible.

Multi-Signature and Oracles

Smart contracts have various features. One is the use of multi-signature (or “multi-sig”) to improve and assure performance. With a multi-sig feature, two or more parties are required to approve a transaction before some other aspect of the contract can move forward. Another featureis the use of an “oracle” to monitor performance of actions, or some other aspect of the real world. A smart EVOO bottling agreement may, for example, automatically generate a quality certificate,once an oracle obtains information that bottler has prepared the material for bottling (bottle, bottle cap, clean label) has been cleaned, prepared, and applied to specifications. The three key steps in developing and utilizing a smart contract are:1.Translating the terms of the contract into code. Since digital systems are deterministic, all possible outcomes of a contract, including penalties for breach of contract and referral to a (non-deterministic) arbitrator, are specified explicitly.2.Agreeing on the precise code that will be run. In practice, parties would usually build their contract from widely used configurable contract modules. Once the contract is agreed upon, it is very important to ensure that the same code actually ends up being executed.3.Executing the code in a trustworthy manner. The code must be run by an impartial third party or by a group of independent entities that are highly unlikely to collude.

Decapolis Dapps (DAP)

DAPs are decentralized applications, which work on the Blockchain and are powered by Smart Contracts. The DAP is fully autonomous and tamper-proof, and doesn’t require a middleman to operate. The DAP establishes a direct connection between a Decapolis Actor providing a service. Through that, Actor scan fully control the information and data they share, in our case between Actor sin the chain of production of Decapolis EVOO.

Smart contracts or Digital Contracts are terms used to describe computer code that can facilitate the exchange of quality assessments. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. Because smart contracts run on the blockchain, they run exactly as programmed without any possibility of censorship, downtime, fraud or third party interference. In this format, contracts could be converted to computer code, stored and replicated on the system and supervised by the network of computers that run the blockchain.

THE USE OF BLOCKCHAIN IN DECAPOLIS FOOD GUARD DFG
The blockchain works like any data system: it takes inputs (for example, the amount of EV olive oil with a certified grade and the intended recipient) and carries out actions based upon these inputs, changing the database in a manner perfectly determined according to the DAP(e.g.,the values in the database would be the amount of a certain grade of product component stored with each actor)and other physical audits. The outcome of the actions applied by the various actors may then be inspected and real-world decisions made accordingly.The approach to the certification and chain-of-custody challenge: a system to assign and verify certifications of certain properties of physical products; e.g., organic, high-quality,or fair trade. At each point in time, the prototype of our model details four key properties concerning all materials and consumables it covers: the nature (what it is), the quality (how it is), the quantity (how much of it there is) and the ownership (whose it is at any moment). Key attributes may be read and linked from pre-existing datasets such as barcodes, or assigned along the way.The blockchain removes the need for a trusted central organization that operates and maintains this system. Using blockchains as a shared and secure platform,we are able to see not only the final state (which mimics the real world in assigning the materials for a given product under the ownership of the final customer). We are able to overcome the weaknesses of current systems by allowing one to securely audit all transactions that brought this state of being into effect; i.e., to inspect the uninterrupted chain of custody from the raw materials to the end sale.The blockchain also gives us an unprecedented level of certainty over the fidelity of the information. We can be sure that all transfers of ownership of the supply chain stages were explicitly authorized by their relevant controllers(Actors)without having to trust the behaviour or competence of an incumbent processor. Interested parties may also audit the production and delivery processes and verify that their “on-chain” persona accurately reflects reality.By design, the blockchain enforces the transparency, security, authenticity, and auditability necessary to make tracing the chain of custody and attributes of products possible. This allows customers to derive the high-quality information needed to make more informed choices. Implementing supply-chain transparency on the blockchain dramatically reduces the high initial cost/benefit ratio for participants, and its naturally distributed design frees a central organization from costly and error-prone operational duties.
